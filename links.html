    <p>
        A link or hyperlink is a connection from one web resource to another. Links allow users to move seamlessly 
        from one page to another, on any server anywhere in the world.

    </p>
    <p>A link has two ends, called anchors.
         The link starts at the source anchor and points to 
         the destination anchor, which may be any web resource, for example, an image, an audio or video clip, a 
        HTML document or an element within the document itself, and so on.

<p>MySQL is free and open-source software under the terms of
     the GNU General Public License, and is also available under a
      variety of proprietary licenses. MySQL was owned and sponsored
       by the Swedish company MySQL AB, which was bought by Sun 
       Microsystems (now Oracle Corporation).[8] Widenius forked the
        open-source MySQL project to create MariaDB.[9]

<p>
    MySQL has stand-alone clients that allow users to
     interact directly with a MySQL database using SQL,
     
    but more often, MySQL is used with other programs to
     implement applications that need relational database capability.
      MySQL is a component of the LAMP web application software stack 
      (and others), which is an acronym for Linux, Apache, MySQL,
       Perl/PHP/Python. MySQL is used by many database-driven web
        applications,including Drupal, Joomla, phpBB, and WordPress.
